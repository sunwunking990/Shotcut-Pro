# ShotcutCPP

## ⚠️ Work In Progress

**This project is currently under active development and is not ready for use.**

## About

ShotcutCPP is an experimental project aimed at reimagining professional video editing software using modern C++ and GPU-accelerated technologies. This is a ground-up development effort exploring high-performance video processing architectures.

## Goals

The project aims to investigate and develop:

- High-performance video processing using modern C++ (C++23)
- GPU-accelerated rendering pipelines with Vulkan
- Efficient timeline and effects architecture for video editing
- Professional-grade audio and video synchronization systems

## Current Status

This project is in early development. The codebase is actively being designed and implemented. Nothing is production-ready, and major architectural changes are ongoing.
